# Claude Code Memory - CFB Power Ratings Model

## Power Ratings Display Preferences

When asked to produce JP+ power ratings:
1. Show O/D/ST (Offense/Defense/Special Teams) component ratings
2. Include each component's ranking in parentheses (e.g., if Indiana has the #1 offense, display as "16.3 (1)")
3. Rankings should show 1 = best for all components
4. Format columns: Rank, Team, Overall, Offense (rank), Defense (rank), Special Teams (rank)
