# Claude Code Memory - CFB Power Ratings Model

## Power Ratings Display Preferences

When asked to produce JP+ power ratings:
1. Show O/D/ST (Offense/Defense/Special Teams) component ratings
2. Include each component's ranking in parentheses (e.g., if Indiana has the #1 offense, display as "16.3 (1)")
3. Rankings should show 1 = best for all components
4. Format columns: Rank, Team, Overall, Offense (rank), Defense (rank), Special Teams (rank)

## Backtest Display Preferences

When presenting backtest results:
1. Always include 2025 in the year range (2022-2025)
2. Always show BOTH vs Opening Line AND vs Closing Line performance
3. Always show 3+ edge AND 5+ edge results
4. Focus on Core Season (Weeks 4-15) as the key performance metric
